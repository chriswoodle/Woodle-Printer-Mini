The Woodle Printer Mini is an Open Source, low cost, small 3D FDM printer.

Designed as a started printer, the Woodle Printer Mini uses standard electronics which can be reused to build a larger  [RepRap printer](http://reprap.org/wiki/Build_A_RepRap).

## Features:
* Under $200 material cost.
* Build volume: 100mm x 120mm x 100mm.
* Bowden-style extruder.
* Arduino Mega + RAMPS controller board.
* 4 NEMA 17 motors.
* Built in carrying handle for easy 3D printing on-the-go.
* (Optional) SD Card printing through [RepRapDiscount Full Graphic Smart Controller](http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller) support.
* (Optional) Heated bed using the [OpenBuilds Mini Heated Bed](http://openbuildspartstore.com/mini-heated-bed/). 
* (Optional) Auto bed leveling with aluminum bed.
